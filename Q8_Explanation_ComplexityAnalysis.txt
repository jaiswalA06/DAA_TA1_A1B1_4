Q.8: Program to remove the nth back node from Linked List

Explanation:-
Here, I first build the linked list using the insert function. To remove the nth node from the back, I calculate its position from the front (size-n). Then I traverse the list until I reach that node, adjust the links to delete node, and free the memory of the deleted node. This way the node gets removed and the list remains intact.

Time Complexity Analysis:-
Since I only go through the list once to reach the node to be deleted, the time complexity is O(n) where n is the size of the list.
