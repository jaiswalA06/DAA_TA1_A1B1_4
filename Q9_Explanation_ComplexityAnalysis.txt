Q.9: Program to Merge two sorted array without extra space

Explanation:-
In this program, I take two sorted arrays and merge them without using any extra space. For each element in the first array, if it is greater than the first element of the second array, I swap them. After swapping, I insert the swapped element into its correct position in the second array by shifting elements (i.e. through insertion sort), ensuring that both arrays remain sorted.

Time Complexity Analysis:-
For every element of the first array, I may need to shift elements in the second array, making the worst-case time complexity O(n Ã— m) (where n and m are sizes of first and second array respectively).
